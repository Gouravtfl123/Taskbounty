# TaskBounty

## Project Description
TaskBounty is a decentralized platform built on the Core Testnet where users can post tasks with a tCORE2 bounty, and workers can submit proof of completion to claim rewards. The smart contract ensures trustless execution by holding funds in escrow until the task creator approves the submission, eliminating intermediaries and enhancing transparency.

## Project Vision
To create a fair, transparent, and intermediary-free micro-task economy on the Core blockchain, enabling global participation in small-scale work with cryptocurrency rewards.

## Key Features
- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks with a short description and deposit a tCORE2 bounty.
- **Task Submission**: Workers can claim and submit tasks, marking them as completed.
- **Task Approval**: Task creators can approve submissions, releasing the bounty to the worker.
- **Escrow System**: Funds are held securely in the contract until approval.
- **Transparency**: All actions are logged via events on the blockchain.

## Future Scope
- Implement dispute resolution through a DAO or third-party arbitrators.
- Add a reputation system to rank task creators and workers.
- Support task categories and deadlines for better organization.
- Integrate with IPFS for storing detailed task descriptions or submission proofs.
